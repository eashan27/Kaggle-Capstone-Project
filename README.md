Aim of The Competition:Predicting Employee Attrition in the Dawn of Recession<br>

Using classification algorithms like Random Forest,Decision tree we had to predict the probablity of an employee attrition by analyzing various features which were dependant on the decision of the attrition;this was done through feature enginnering and Exploratory Data analysis to retreive the most relevant features from the dataset provided.XGBoost provided with the most good results with the help of grid search cv which is a famous algorithm for hyperparameter tuning.<br>

Dataset has been provided by IBM
